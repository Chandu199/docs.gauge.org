    .. tab:: Html-Report

        .. code-block:: console

            gauge install html-report

        Read more `here <https://github.com/getgauge/html-report>`__

    .. tab:: Xml-Report

        .. code-block:: console

            gauge install xml-report

        Read more `here <https://github.com/getgauge/xml-report>`__

.. _documentation_plugins:

Documentation Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Documentation plugins generate readable and easy to navigate documentation from the specs.

.. tab-container:: documentation

    .. tab:: Spectacle

        .. code-block:: console

            gauge install spectacle

        Read more `here <https://github.com/getgauge/spectacle>`__


Install a specific plugin version 
---------------------------------

To install a specific version of a plugin use the ``--version`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report --version 2.1.0


Add plugin to a project
-----------------------

Run ``gauge install <plugin_name>`` from within the project directory, to install
the plugin and add it to project. If plugin is already installed it just add it to the project.


Offline Installation of Plugin
------------------------------

Any Gauge plugin can be installed from a zip file instead of downloading
from plugin repository by using the ``--file`` or ``-f`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report --file ZIP_FILE_PATH

Download the latest version of plugin from the ``Releases`` section of
the respective repository. See `plugin list <//gauge.org/plugins/>`__ to
find the repositories.

Updating plugins
----------------

Run ``gauge update <plugin_name>`` to update the plugin. 
This downloads the latest compatible plugin from our plugin repository.

.. note:: 
    Every Gauge plugin when published, has metadata indicating the ``min`` and ``max`` version of Gauge that
    it is compatible with. This is used when installing plugin on a system running a particular gauge version.

**Example:**

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update java

To update a plugin to a specific version, use the ``--version``
flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update java --version 0.3.2

You can also update all the installed plugins by running

.. code-block:: console

    gauge update --all

Read the :ref:`Installation troubleshooting <troubleshoot_plugin_installation>` for more.

.. note::

    The html-report and screenshot plugins are installed automatically on the first run.

Discovering Project templates
-----------------------------

Gauge hosts a list of project templates, to help setup specific type of projects. 
Run ``gauge init --templates`` to see the list of available templates.

Troubleshooting
===============

Logs
----

-  Gauge logs are created under the ``logs`` directory in the project.
-  Three log files are created
    -  **gauge.log** - logs for test execution
    -  **api.log** - logs for gauge core api exposed for plugins
    -  **lsp.log** - logs for gauge when launched in LSP mode.

-  To customize logs directory set the ``logs_directory`` property in the ``env/default/default.properties`` file to a custom logs directory path.

.. code-block:: text

    logs_directory = my_logs_dir

-  For **non-project specific actions** like plugin installation log
   files are created in the following location.

.. code-block:: text

     Windows - %APPDATA%\gauge\logs
     MacOS*  - <user_home>/.gauge/logs
     Linux   - <user_home>/.gauge/logs

.. _troubleshoot_gauge_installation:

Gauge Installation
------------------

Windows
^^^^^^^

-  The default installation location is ``%ProgramFiles%\gauge``.

-  ``gauge_install_location\bin`` should be in PATH to run from command line.

-  Gauge plugins are installed at ``%APPDATA%\gauge\plugins`` directory.

-  `APPDATA <https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/app-settings/store-and-retrieve-app-data>`__ directory is usually located at ``C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming``.

Mac OS X
^^^^^^^^

-  The default installation location is ``/usr/local/``.

-  ``usr/local/bin/`` or ``custom_install_location/bin`` should be in PATH.

-  Run ``brew update`` before installing the latest version of gauge.

-  If installation is failing `Upgrade homebrew <http://docs.brew.sh/FAQ.html#how-do-i-update-my-local-packages>`__

-  Gauge plugins are installed under ``~/.gauge/plugins`` directory.

Linux
^^^^^

-  The default installation location is ``/usr/local/``.

-  ``usr/local/bin/`` or ``custom_install_location/bin`` should be in PATH.

-  Gauge plugins are installed under ``~/.gauge/plugins`` directory.

.. _troubleshoot_plugin_installation:

Plugin installation
-------------------

-  If :ref:`plugin installation <install_plugins>` fails due to a network connection issue, you can **manually download** the plugin distributable zip and install it using the ``-f`` flag.

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install plugin_name -f path_to_zip_file

Example:

.. code-block:: console

    gauge install html-report -f html-report-1.0.3-darwin.x86.zip

-  Find the plugin zip files under ``Releases`` section of the plugin github repositories. See the `gauge plugin list <https://gauge.org/plugins/>`__ for plugin repositories details.

Plugins directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Plugins are installed in the ``.gauge/plugins`` directory in user's home. You can check this directory to manually install / uninstall plugins as well as to verify the installed plugins.

The plugin installation directory for various operating systems are listed below.

-  **Windows:** ``%APPDATA%\.gauge\plugins``
-  **Mac OS X:** ``~/.gauge/plugins``
-  **Linux:** ``~/.gauge/plugins``

Custom Plugin Install location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default the plugins are stored at ``%APPDATA%\gauge\plugins`` for windows and ``~/.gauge/plugins`` in mac and linux.

To install plugins at different location, set ``GAUGE_HOME`` environment variable to the custom location. After setting the ``GAUGE_HOME`` env, run the install command. The plugin will get installed at the ``GAUGE_HOME`` custom location.
